Copied all starter kit files (DimABSAModel.py, Utils.py, DataProcess.py, run_task2&3_trainer_multilingual.py, Readme.txt). Created symlink to dataset at data/track_a. Created README.md with quick start guide.","Successfully adapted DimABSAModel.py to use DeBERTa-v3-base. Changed import from BertModel to DebertaV2Model. Model instantiation tested successfully with microsoft/deberta-v3-base. All 11 classifiers (8 span detection, 1 category, 2 VA regression) remain unchanged. Model accepts token_type_ids parameter (DeBERTa will ignore it).","Modified training script to use DeBERTa-v3-base as default model. Changed line 97 from bert-base-multilingual-uncased to microsoft/deberta-v3-base. Fixed data symlink to use correct relative path (../../DimABSA2026/task-dataset/track_a). Verified data access to eng_restaurant and eng_laptop train/dev files. Created training scripts: train_restaurant.sh and train_laptop.sh with proper configuration (task=2, batch_size=8, epochs=3, lr=1e-3, deberta_lr=1e-5, beta=0.9). Utils.py and DataProcess.py require no changes as they are model-agnostic.","Data loading tested successfully. All 4 data files accessible: Restaurant train (2,284 samples), Restaurant dev (200 samples), Laptop train (4,076 samples), Laptop dev (200 samples). Files contain correct structure with ID, Text, and Quadruplet keys for training data. Dev files have ID and Text only (for inference). Installed sentencepiece library required for DeBERTa tokenizer. Tokenizer loads successfully and produces correct tokens.","Training test executed successfully up to model initialization. Data loading works perfectly: max token length 105, max aspect/opinion length 15, max 26 aspects per sample. Training failed on Mac due to no CUDA (expected). Code is ready for GPU training on Kaggle/Colab. All components verified: model instantiation, data loading, tokenization, preprocessing. Created SETUP_COMPLETE.md with full summary and next steps."],"modified_files":["/Users/vishal.thenuwara/Documents/MSC/Research/Coding/Competition/DimABSANew/Pipeline-DeBERTa/README.md","/Users/vishal.thenuwara/Documents/MSC/Research/Coding/Competition/DimABSANew/Pipeline-DeBERTa/DimABSAModel.py","/Users/vishal.thenuwara/Documents/MSC/Research/Coding/Competition/DimABSANew/Pipeline-DeBERTa/run_task2&3_trainer_multilingual.py","/Users/vishal.thenuwara/Documents/MSC/Research/Coding/Competition/DimABSANew/Pipeline-DeBERTa/train_restaurant.sh","/Users/vishal.thenuwara/Documents/MSC/Research/Coding/Competition/DimABSANew/Pipeline-DeBERTa/train_laptop.sh","/Users/vishal.thenuwara/Documents/MSC/Research/Coding/Competition/DimABSANew/Pipeline-DeBERTa/test_data_files.py","/Users/vishal.thenuwara/Documents/MSC/Research/Coding/Competition/DimABSANew/Pipeline-DeBERTa/test_train.sh","/Users/vishal.thenuwara/Documents/MSC/Research/Coding/Competition/DimABSANew/Pipeline-DeBERTa/SETUP_COMPLETE.md"],"id":"1768965127810"}
