Restaurant: 2284 samples, max=26, avg=1.6. Laptop: 4076 samples, max=10, avg=1.42. Optimal threshold=4 keeps 98.9-99% data with ~10.6GB memory (safe for 16GB GPU).","Created filter_outliers.py script. Filtered both datasets with threshold=4. Restaurant: 2284→2258 samples (98.86%), memory 67GB→10.3GB. Laptop: 4076→4035 samples (98.99%), memory 26GB→10.3GB. Both safe for 16GB GPU with batch_size=1.","Updated kaggle_pipeline_deberta.ipynb: Added Step 2 for filtering outliers with inline Python code. Updated training commands to use filtered datasets (_filtered.jsonl). Changed batch_size from 4→2 for safety. Updated descriptions to reflect filtered sample counts.","Created SOLUTION_OUTLIER_FILTERING.md with complete documentation: problem summary, solution details, implementation steps, results (memory 67GB→10.3GB, data loss <2%), usage instructions, testing results, and future work.
