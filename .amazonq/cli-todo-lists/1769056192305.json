Restaurant: 2258 samples, max_aspects=4, memory safe. Ready to switch to DeBERTa-v3-base.","Changed default model in run_task2&3_trainer_multilingual.py from bert-base-uncased to microsoft/deberta-v3-base. Memory estimation: ~12.9GB with batch_size=1 and max_aspects=4 (tight but possible on 16GB GPU).","Updated kaggle_pipeline_deberta.ipynb: Changed title back to DeBERTa, updated all training commands to use microsoft/deberta-v3-base with batch_size=1, updated descriptions to reflect DeBERTa configuration.","Created DEBERTA_SWITCH.md with complete documentation: memory analysis (12.9GB with batch_size=1), configuration details, usage instructions, verification steps, troubleshooting guide, and comparison table. Memory estimation shows DeBERTa should work safely on 16GB GPU with filtered datasets.","Committed and pushed all changes to GitHub (commit f9ff5bb). Includes DeBERTa configuration, updated notebook, memory estimation script, and complete documentation. Ready for Kaggle testing."],"modified_files":["Pipeline-DeBERTa/run_task2&3_trainer_multilingual.py","kaggle_pipeline_deberta.ipynb","DEBERTA_SWITCH.md","scripts/estimate_deberta_memory.py"],"id":"1769056192305"}
